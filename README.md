# TEECE 2 Capstone Project

## Lifestyle and Learning ‚Äì Predicting Student Performance

This project explores how student lifestyle habits and mental health status influence academic performance. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 student records, it combines data analysis and machine learning to uncover patterns and build predictive models.

---

### Research Question

**How does mental health status influence the relationship between lifestyle habits and academic performance?**

---

### üß† Project Overview

The dataset includes variables like:

- **Study Hours**
- **Atendance**
- **Sleep Patterns**
- **Part Time Job**
- **Screen Time**
- **Diet**
- **Exercise Frequency**
- **Mental Health**
- **Final Exam Score**

These features are analyzed to understand their individual and combined impact on student performance. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, clustering, regression modeling, and optional classification.

---

### Objectives

- Explore the interaction between mental health, lifestyle, and academic results.
- Discover student groupings using clustering techniques.
- Build models to predict final exam scores based on lifestyle and mental health data.
- Optionally, classify students into performance levels.
- Derive practical insights and recommendations for students.

### Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Linear, Decision Tree & Random Forest Regression**
- **Classification Models (Optional)**

## üìä Key Methods

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Scaled numeric features
- Engineered new features (e.g., combined screen time)

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Visualized distributions, relationships, and correlations
- Compared mental health and lifestyle impacts on scores

### 3. **Clustering**
- Used K-Means on lifestyle and mental health features
- Identified distinct student profiles

### 4. **Regression**
- Trained Linear, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
- Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R¬≤, and cross-validation

### 5. **(Optional) Classification**
- Categorized scores into Low, Average, High
- Trained classification models and evaluated them
